Summer brings hot days and long evenings. Many families enjoy camping and swimming. Fall arrives with cooler temperatures and colorful leaves. Farmers harvest their crops. Winter is the coldest season. Snow covers the ground, and people enjoy skating and skiing. Each season offers different activities and beautiful sights.",

            "text": "Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to make their own food. Plants need three main ingredients: sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide from the air. Inside plant leaves are special cells containing chlorophyll, which gives leaves their green color. Chlorophyll captures energy from sunlight. This energy is used to combine water from the roots with carbon dioxide from the air. Through this chemical reaction, plants produce glucose, a type of sugar that provides energy. As a byproduct, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere. This oxygen is essential for most living things to breathe. Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth because it provides food for plants and oxygen for animals. Without this process, most life forms could not survive.",
