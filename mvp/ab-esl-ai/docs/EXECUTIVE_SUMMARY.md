# AB-ESL-AI: Executive Summary for Procurement Board

## The Opportunity

**Alberta faces a literacy crisis at the intersection of three converging challenges:**

| Challenge | Impact | Current Response |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Plummeting Literacy Rates** | 30% of Grade 3 students below reading benchmark | More testing, same interventions |
| **Surging Newcomer Population** | 40%+ ELL students in urban schools | Overwhelmed ESL specialists |
| **Teacher Shortage** | 1 ESL specialist per 500+ ELL students | Classroom teachers without training |

**The fundamental problem:** Each ELL student needs individualized, L1-informed instruction, but there aren't enough trained ESL teachers to provide it.

---

## The Solution: AB-ESL-AI

**AB-ESL-AI is not another EdTech app—it's ESL specialist expertise embedded in AI that works at scale.**

### What Makes It Different

| Typical EdTech | AB-ESL-AI |
|----------------|-----------|
| Generic content | **L1-informed pedagogy** for 13 languages |
| US curriculum | **Alberta ELA + ESL Benchmarks** built-in |
| Student-only | **Teacher amplifier** + family engagement |
| Reactive assessment | **Predictive intervention** (catches struggles 4-6 weeks early) |
| Age-inappropriate for SLIFE | **Dedicated SLIFE pathways** |
| US data centers | **Canadian data residency** (FOIP compliant) |
| Online-only | **Offline-first** (works in rural Alberta) |

## Return on Investment

### Cost Comparison

| Approach | Annual Cost | Students Served | Cost per Student |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Hire ESL Specialists** | $95,000/teacher | 25 students | **$3,800** |
| **Traditional EdTech** | $50-100/student | Per license | **$75** |
| **AB-ESL-AI (District License)** | $25,000/year | 500+ students | **$50** |

### Time Savings for Teachers

| Task | Without AB-ESL-AI | With AB-ESL-AI | Weekly Savings |
|------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Differentiating materials | 3 hours | 20 minutes | **2.5 hours** |
| Creating assessments | 2 hours | 10 minutes | **1.75 hours** |
| Progress monitoring | 2 hours | 15 minutes (automated) | **1.75 hours** |
| Family communication | 1 hour | 5 minutes (auto-translated) | **0.9 hours** |
| **Total Weekly Savings** | | | **~7 hours/teacher** |

### Projected Annual Savings (100-teacher district)

- **Teacher time recovered:** 7 hours × 40 weeks × 100 teachers = **28,000 hours**
- **Dollar value:** 28,000 × $45/hour = **$1,260,000** in recovered capacity
- **License cost:** ~$50,000 (district-wide)
- **Net ROI:** **25:1 return**

## Key Differentiators for Alberta

### 1. L1 Linguistic Transfer Intelligence

**Why it matters:** Arabic speakers struggle with articles (none in Arabic). Chinese speakers struggle with tense markers (none in Chinese). Generic feedback doesn't help—L1-specific feedback does.

**What we do:** Predict errors before they happen, explain WHY errors occur in L1 context, generate exercises targeting specific transfer challenges.

**Languages supported:** Arabic, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog, Punjabi, Ukrainian, Somali, Vietnamese, Farsi/Dari, Hindi, Urdu, French

### 2. Alberta Curriculum DNA

**Why it matters:** Teachers need to report against Alberta ELA outcomes and ESL Benchmarks. Generic tools require manual mapping.

**What we do:** Every activity auto-maps to Alberta outcomes. Progress reports speak Alberta's language. PAT preparation built-in.

### 3. Predictive Intervention Engine

**Why it matters:** Traditional assessment catches struggling students at report card time—too late for effective intervention.

**What we do:** ML-based early warning identifies at-risk students 4-6 weeks early. Generates prescriptive intervention plans aligned to benchmarks.

### 4. Family Literacy Co-Pilot

**Why it matters:** Many newcomer parents are also learning English. Schools send home materials parents can't read.

**What we do:** Bilingual homework helpers, SMS-delivered micro-lessons, progress celebrations in home language.

### 5. SLIFE Support

**Why it matters:** Students with Limited/Interrupted Formal Education (SLIFE) are invisible in standard EdTech. A 14-year-old with 2 years of schooling can't use grade-level materials.

**What we do:** Age-appropriate content at low reading levels. Life skills integration (bus schedules, forms, menus). Oral language priority pathway.

### 6. Privacy by Design

**Why it matters:** Student data must stay in Canada. FOIP compliance is non-negotiable.

**What we do:** Canadian data residency, k-anonymity enforcement, automated PII detection, audit trails, consent management.

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Pilot** | Month 1-3 | 5 schools, 50 teachers, 500 students |
| **Evaluation** | Month 4 | Efficacy data, teacher feedback, refinements |
| **Expansion** | Month 5-8 | District-wide rollout |
| **Full Deployment** | Month 9-12 | All schools, integration with SIS |

### Pilot Requirements

- Chrome/Edge browser (works on Chromebooks)
- Internet connection (or pre-cached offline mode)
- 30 minutes teacher training (self-paced online)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Teacher adoption | Self-paced training + in-app guidance + champion teachers |
| Data privacy | FOIP-compliant architecture, Canadian hosting, audit trails |
| Connectivity | Offline-first design, aggressive caching |
| AI accuracy | Human-in-the-loop design, teacher override, continuous improvement |
| Vendor lock-in | Open data export, standard formats, no proprietary lock-in |

## Competitive Landscape

### Why Not Duolingo/Rosetta Stone?

- Designed for adult self-study, not K-12 classroom instruction
- No teacher tools, no curriculum alignment, no progress reporting
- No L1-informed pedagogy, no SLIFE support

### Why Not Lexia/Achieve3000/IXL?

- US curriculum focused, requires Alberta mapping
- No L1 transfer intelligence (treats all ELLs the same)
- No family engagement in home languages
- US data centers (FOIP concerns)
- Retrofitted for ELLs, not purpose-built

### Why AB-ESL-AI?

- **Purpose-built** for Canadian K-12 ELL instruction
- **Alberta curriculum native** (not adapted)
- **L1-informed** (not generic)
- **Teacher amplifier** (not replacement)
- **Family inclusive** (not student-only)
- **FOIP compliant** (not US-hosted)
